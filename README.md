## Test locally
Example command to run tests:
#### Run one testing suite
```bash
go test -v ./test/suites/device-mqtt
```

Flag `-v` is for verbose output.

#### Run all suites
```bash
go test -v -p 1 ./test/suites/...
```

The `-p 1` is set to force sequential run and avoid snapd and logical errors when running multipe testing suites.

#### Run one suite with env variables
The environment variables are defined in [test/utils/env.go](./test/utils/env.go)

Full config test:
```bash
FULL_CONFIG_TEST=true go test -v ./test/suites/device-mqtt
```

Testing with a local snap:
```bash
LOCAL_SNAP="edgex-device-mqtt_2.0.1-dev.15_amd64.snap" go test -v --count=1 ./test/suites/device-mqtt
```
The `--count=1` flag is to avoid Go test caching when testing the rebuilt snap.

Test by revision:
```
PLATFORM_CHANNEL=4259 go test -v ./test/suites/edgex-no-sec
```
This requires developer access; see `snap install -h` for details.

#### Run only one test from a suite
```
go test -v ./test/suites/edgexfoundry --run=TestAddProxyUser
```
```
go test -v ./test/suites/edgex-config-provider -run=TestConfigProvider/device-virtual
```

#### Test the testing utils
```bash
go test ./test/utils -count=10
```

## Test using Github Actions
This project includes two Github Actions that can be used in workflows to test snaps:
* [build](./build): Checkout code, build the snap, and upload snap as build artifact
* [test](./test): Download the snap from build artifacts (optional) and run smoke tests

A workflow that uses both the actions from `v2` branch may look as follows:

`.github/workflows/snap.yml`
```yaml
name: Snap Testing

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  # allow manual trigger
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build and upload snap
        id: build
        uses: canonical/edgex-snap-testing/build@v2
    outputs:
      snap: ${{steps.build.outputs.snap}}

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download and test snap
        uses: canonical/edgex-snap-testing/test@v2
        with:
          name: device-mqtt
          snap: ${{needs.build.outputs.snap}}
```
