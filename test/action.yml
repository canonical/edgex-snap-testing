name: EdgeX Snap Tester
description: |
  This Github action runs various smoke tests to validate the snap packaging.

  When 'snap' input is set, the snap is downloaded from build artifacts and
  its absolute path is passed to the tests.
  In this case, the value of channel is not used.

inputs:
  name:
    description: Name of the testing suite
    required: true
  snap:
    description: Relative path to local snap
    required: false
  channel:
    description: |
      Channel for downloading the snap from store.
      This is useful only when 'snap' input is not set.
    required: false
  platform_channel:
    description: |
      Channel for downloading the edgexfoundry snap from store.
      This is used when testing services against the edgexfoundry snap.
      This is useful only when 'snap' input is not set.
